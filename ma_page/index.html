<p class="box">The Germany international has one year remaining on his contract and, as a result, there’s been plenty of speculation on his future.
  But Mesut is keen to remain at Emirates Stadium.
"It is definitely my preference to stay,” he said. "It is such a great club and I have always said that I feel very good at Arsenal.
"Once everyone is back in London we will sit down and discuss about the future.
"For now the most important thing is our pre-season and getting through the tour, training and getting fitness. When I’m back in London, we will sit down and discuss."</p>
